Brian Muraresku is an author and scholar who wrote the book “The Immortality Key: The Secret History of the Religion with No Name.” In the book, Muraresku explores the history of psychoactive substances and their role in ancient religions and rituals. He suggests that the use of these substances played a significant role in the development of many of the world’s major religions and spiritual practices, and argues that they may hold the key to understanding the origins of religious belief and experience.
